## Question 1

Write a function to compute the Euclidean norm of a vector (square root of sum of squared elements in a vector).
Namely, for a vector $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p)$, the Euclidean norm of $x$ is
$$|x|_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_p^2)^{1/2}.$$
```{r}
EuclideanNorm = function(x){
  res = sqrt(sum(x^2))
  return(res)
}

EuclideanNorm(c(1 : 5))

EuclideanNorm(-10)
```
